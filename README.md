Regression Model Comparison on California Housing Dataset


This repository demonstrates the application of regression algorithms on the California Housing dataset to predict median house prices. Various models were implemented, and their performances were compared using key evaluation metrics: MSE, MAE, and RÂ².

Implemented Models:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
