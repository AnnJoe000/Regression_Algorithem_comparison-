Regression Comparison Plan

1. Loading and Preprocessing

Load the Dataset:
  Use fetch_california_housing from sklearn.datasets.
  Convert the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.

Handle Missing Values:
  Check for missing values using isnull() and handle them (if any) using methods like fillna() or dropna().

Feature Scaling:
  Standardize the dataset using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to ensure all features are on the same scale.

Justification: 
  Regression models can perform better when the features are standardized, especially algorithms like Support Vector Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Documentation:
  Add markdown cells to explain preprocessing steps and why they are necessary.


2. Regression Algorithm Implementation 
Implement and evaluate the following algorithms:
  Linear Regression:
  Explain:
    A simple regression method that models the relationship between independent variables and the target as a linear equation.
  Suitability:
    Easy to interpret, performs well on datasets with linear relationships.
  

Decision Tree Regressor:
  Explain:
    A tree-based model that splits data into subsets based on feature values.
  Suitability: 
    Handles non-linear relationships well and doesn't require scaling.


Random Forest Regressor:
  Explain:
    An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
  Suitability:
    Robust to outliers and handles complex relationships.


Gradient Boosting Regressor:
  Explain: 
    An ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, correcting errors of the previous tree.
  Suitability: 
    Works well on smaller datasets and captures complex relationships.


Support Vector Regressor (SVR):
  Explain: 
    A regression method that finds the hyperplane within a margin of tolerance for errors.
  Suitability:
    Effective for high-dimensional datasets after feature scaling.


Implementation Steps:
Import necessary libraries: sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.tree, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.svm.
Train-test split using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Train models on the training set and make predictions on the test set.

3. Model Evaluation and Comparison 

Evaluate each model using these metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 
  Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 
  Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
RÂ² Score: 
  Indicates how much variance in the target variable is explained by the model.
Compare Results:
Create a table or plot to compare metrics for each model.

Identify:
Best-performing algorithm: Justify based on metrics and dataset characteristics.
Worst-performing algorithm: Reason out why it performed poorly (e.g., overfitting, sensitivity to scaling, etc.).
